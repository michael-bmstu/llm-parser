## Key Indicators of IFRS Financial Reporting that will be parsed

Financial reporting under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) includes several key indicators that help assess a company's financial position and performance. Here are the main ones:

### 1. Revenue (Выручка)
- The total amount of income generated from the company's core activities, including sales of goods and services.

### 2. Profit Before Tax (Прибыль до налогообложения)
- The profit earned before tax deductions, reflecting the operational efficiency of the company.

### 3. Net Profit (Чистая прибыль)
- The profit remaining after all expenses, including taxes, have been deducted. This is a key indicator showing how much money the company earned during the reporting period.

### 4. Assets (Активы)
- The total value of all company assets, including current assets (e.g., cash, accounts receivable) and non-current assets (e.g., property, equipment).

### 5. Liabilities (Обязательства)
- The total amount of debts and obligations of the company, including both short-term and long-term liabilities.

### 6. Equity (Капитал)
- The difference between assets and liabilities, reflecting the company's net worth.

### 7. Liquidity Ratios (Коэффициенты ликвидности)
- For example, the current ratio (current assets / current liabilities) and quick ratio, which help assess the company's ability to cover its short-term obligations.

### 8. Profitability Ratios (Коэффициенты рентабельности)
- For example, Return on Assets (ROA) and Return on Equity (ROE), which indicate how effectively the company uses its resources to generate profit.

### 9. Cash Flows (Денежные потоки)
- The cash flow statement shows how money is received and spent by the company, including operating, investing, and financing cash flows.

### 10. Comparative Indicators (Сравнительные показатели)
- Comparison of key indicators with previous periods or similar companies in the industry to assess trends and competitiveness.

These indicators help investors, analysts, and other stakeholders make informed decisions based on the company's financial reporting.
